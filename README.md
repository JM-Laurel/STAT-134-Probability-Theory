# STAT-134 Probability Theory

University of California, Berkeley (Summer 2019)

**Author**: John-Michael Laurel

**Remarks:** *This document assumes understanding of basic probabilistic knowledge such as independence, conditioning, Bayes' rule, joint distributions, et cetera, counting methods (combinatorics), and set theory e.g. deMorgan's laws. Happy Studying :coffee:*
